# Guide to Contributing
(Also, please make pull requests on the `public` branch, `main` is for the current release (which will exist when the game is runnable)

## Rules for Development
1. Must have a github account
2. Must send your github account so someone can add you as contributor
3. We use godot
4. Follow common sense (ie; no sabotage, follow server rules, etc,.)

## Rules for Helping
1. Just follow server rules
2. Don't be *too* silly

## Basic Dev Requirements
1. Some knowledge of godot
> - Know how to use godot, if you never have, just look at an example project to get a feel for it.
2. Some knowledge of github
> - Know how to use github
3. Some knowledge of game development
> - Know how programming works to a basic degree, C# or gdscript knowledge is helpful

## Art Contributions
1. If you can draw a circle you're good enough
2. Coordination is key, but don't worry about feeling like you have not done enough, a single asset is a great help
3. If you notice something missing, ask, someone might already be working on it.
4. Pixel art is *probably* the best (Draightmare is the lead pixel artist)
5. Depending on how many people there are- art may not be used, however there will probably be a *secret* debug or ending room that contains all assets used.

### EVERYBODY, and I mean everyone who helps will have their name in the credits if they want.
